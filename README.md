# Pattern Printing, Number Analysis, and Inventory Management in Python

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to demonstrate a variety of concepts, including:

- Pattern generation.
- Number analysis using user input.
- Inventory management using object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Prime number validation and series generation.
These programs provide examples of Python's versatility in solving mathematical problems, working with loops and conditions, and implementing object-oriented concepts.

## Tools and Technologies Used 

1. Programming Language:
- Python 3.x
- Widely used for its simplicity and versatility.
2. Key Concepts:
- Loops: for and while loops are used for iterating over sequences and conditions.
- Conditionals: if-else statements determine logical branches.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
a) Encapsulation via classes (Item, Inventory).
b) Modular and reusable design.
3. Mathematical Operations:
- Sum, product, and absolute difference computations.
- Prime number validation using modulus and iteration.
4. User Interaction:
- Use of input() for collecting user data.
- Input validation for odd/even numbers and positive integers.
5.Formatting:
- f-strings: Used for neatly formatting output.
- Tabular Display: Inventory details are formatted for better readability.

## Conclusion:

This project showcases Python's capabilities across different problem domains, from simple loops to complex inventory management systems. The combination of mathematical logic, user interaction, and OOP demonstrates Pythonâ€™s strength as a beginner-friendly yet powerful language for both learning and professional tasks.
